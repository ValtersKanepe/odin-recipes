# odin-recipes

Hello Odin!

First project of the Odin project

In this project we practiced using basic building blocks of html, how to link to other pages and internet resources and how to do basic inline formatting.

We made a recipe page that links to 3 other recipees.

Overall this project gave a good introduction and basic understanding of how to make websites.

As well as served as a good practice for actually making/modifying files trough command line and practically using git.
