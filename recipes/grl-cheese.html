<h1>How to make grilled cheese sandwich</h1>
<p>
    No matter the hour (or your age), a grilled cheese sandwich is the pinnacle of crave-worthiness. This rendition doesn't attempt to reinvent the classic. It just guides you toward making the best-ever version of it. But there are a few rules you must follow:
</p>
<h2>Grilled cheese Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 slices - thick Pullman or other white bread</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
    <li>2 ounces thinly sliced American cheese or cheddar (about 4 slices)</li>
    <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Make Grilled Cheese</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Butter the toast</strong> - spread 1/2 Tbsp butter on one side of each slice of bread.</li>
    <li><strong>Heat skillet</strong> - place a skillet over low to medium/low heat. A griddle should be at 275F. Immediately add 2 slices of bread with the butter-side-down.</li>
    <li><strong>Add cheese</strong> - stack cheeses on one of the pieces of bread, cover with the other piece of toast and flip the sandwich over.</li>
    <li><strong>Brown the toast</strong> - Continue sauteeing, flipping once, until both sides are golden brown and cheese is melted.</li>
    <li><strong>Serve</strong> - cut the sandwich in half on the diagonal to serve.</li> 
</ol>
